## Technologies Used

The 3D Calculator is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: For structuring the application and creating a semantic layout.
- **CSS3**: For styling the calculator, enhancing usability and aesthetic appeal.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the functionality of the calculator, including event handling and calculations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the 3D Calculator, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Basic understanding of how to navigate files on your computer

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codingAjayKumar/3D-Calculator.git
   cd 3d-calculator

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd 3d-calculator
3. **Open the index.html File**: You can open the index.html file directly in your web browser. Alternatively, you can use a local server setup (like Live Server in VS Code) for a better experience.

## File Structure
```bash
/3d-calculator
├── index.html         # Main HTML file
├── styles.css         # CSS file for styling the calculator
└── script.js          # JavaScript file containing the logic
```
## How to Use

### Basic Operations:

- Click on the number buttons to input numbers.
- Use the operator buttons to perform calculations.
- Press `=` to see the result.

### Advanced Functions:

- Use `%` to calculate percentages.
- Use `√` to calculate the square root of the current number.

### Memory Functions:

- **M+** to store the current display value in memory.
- **MR** to recall the stored memory value.
- **MC** to clear the stored memory.
- **M**- to subtract the current display value from the stored memory.

### Clear Display:

- Press **C** to clear the current input.

## Future Enhancements

- **Calculation History**: Implement a feature to display a history of calculations.
- **Scientific Functions**: Include more advanced mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, etc.
- **Improved User Interface**: Enhance the UI with animations and better layouts.
